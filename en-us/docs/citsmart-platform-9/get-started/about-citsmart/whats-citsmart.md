CITSmart is a product that had its initial construction to meet the needs of ITSM (IT Service Management), mainly for the fulfillment of the ITIL requirements, preached by the institution Pink Elephant, through PinkVerify certification.

Evolution
------------

The main change introduced in the last year was the focus on business processes beyond IT, that is, Corporate Service Management, a proof of this is the adaptation of the service statement that became Connecting processes, delivering experiences.

This decision was based on the capacity of our Workflow to adapt to various business needs, and Neuro, by allowing the construction of new data inputs and integration possibilities.
We also created in the year 2018 the products CE - Center of Experiences. This product is aimed to create a digital workspace builder. 

Anuva
-----

ANUVA was also initiated and represents the Artificial Intelligence of CITSmart, where it promotes integration and machine learning with knowledge.

Neuro
-----

NEURO is a product that has been 100% ready and adequate within CITSmart, this product is very powerful and allows to build new functionalities, applications and integrations. It is very close to RPA (Robotics process automation) products, but it brings different possibilities, such as the natural integration with the Service Management framework (SLAs, knowledge, portfolio, tickets, service portal, among others).

In addition, we understand that the concepts of Service Management is very powerful and can go beyond IT, allowing interesting gains to the business units.
