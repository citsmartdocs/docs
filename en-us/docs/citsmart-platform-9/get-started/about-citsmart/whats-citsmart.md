CITSmart History
--------------------

CITSmart is a product that had its initial construction to meet the needs of ITSM (IT Service Management), mainly for the fulfillment of the ITIL requirements, preached by the institution Pink Elephant, through PinkVerify certification. Currently, CITSmart meets all the certification processes. The main functionalities are Ticket Management (incidents and requests), Service Portfolio and Catalog, Knowledge Base, Changes and CMDB. The current CITSmart target audience are companies that have IT departments, as well as the need of ITSM solutions to manage their ITs.

Evolution
------------

The main change introduced in the last year was the focus on business processes beyond IT, that is, Corporate Service Management, a proof of this is the adaptation of the service statement that became Connecting processes, delivering experiences.

This decision was based on the capacity of our Workflow to adapt to various business needs, and Neuro, by allowing the construction of new data inputs and integration possibilities. We also created in the year 2018 the products EC - Experience Center. This product is aimed to create a digital workspace builder. 

Anuva
-----

ANUVA was also initiated and represents the Artificial Intelligence of CITSmart, where it promotes integration and machine learning with knowledge.

Neuro
-----

NEURO is a product that has been 100% ready and adequate within CITSmart, this product is very powerful and allows to build new functionalities, applications and integrations. It is very close to RPA (Robotics process automation) products, but it brings different possibilities, such as the natural integration with the Service Management framework (SLAs, knowledge, portfolio, tickets, service portal, among others). In addition, we understand that the concepts of Service Management is very powerful and can go beyond IT, allowing interesting gains to the business units.

## Get ready for the change

Flexibility, adaptability and preparation for change is what will define the companies that will survive and those that will no longer exist. So whoever goes ahead is not the one who predicts the future, but who follows it.

Some companies have difficulty moving quickly, not only due to the number of people or processes, but also mainly due to their motivation, the speed of releasing new products and ideas is very fast, because everyone is mainly involved in the result.

*Being prepared for the future is being prepared for change.*

-   Quick changes is helping people to change.

-   Supporting change in people is quickly changing the processes.

If this is the trinomial for Quick and Painless Change, what is the reason for such difficulty? The main reason is that it doesn’t make sense to think about processes if those processes don’t lead to results and goals. Perhaps processes are the means, not the end. The end is always the new results. Process management is not enough for this.

## Services… Delivering value

Which concept would be most appropriate to delivery value? Have you thought about the concept of services? You must be thinking:

-   What do you mean?

-   What services has to do with me?

It doesn't matter the field of action; you have to deliver value to someone. In this new economy, many people understand this value as experience and this concept is the new way to connect with the new generation of customers. 

A concept of services:

*"It is a product of human activity that satisfies a need. Represents value to someone."*

Services set goals. It essentially represents "results" and "achievement of objectives". It's what everyone is looking for.

It is easy to think of services for end customers, the entire customer experience is made up of them; however, have you heard of corporate services? Perhaps the term is new, but it's simple, it's to place internal areas or departments to provide results for each other. It changes everything.

With this concept of "corporate services", a larger administration or organization can easily adapt. Think and adapt to the new results that will have to be provided by each department (and general) and then each department will adapt internally in terms of processes. The focus was fully adapted, as well as the responsiveness and motivation.

## Services of Excellence

Service management is no longer just for IT. As digitalization spreads across companies, it meets the needs of all departments. Service management has expanded to represent new ways of supporting business, aligning departments, eliminating silos, improving resource utilization, automating processes and providing better management for the entire company, thereby reducing costs.

What concerns most companies is to define what separates a good customer experience from a bad one. Today, in the business world, many of the company's own needs tend to overshadow the needs of customers.

CITSmart believes that the focus of the business should be on a good customer experience and be one step ahead, depending on how services and processes are connected.

This is the new mindset for new companies and the CITSmart Platform will help to change the perspective of these corporations.
