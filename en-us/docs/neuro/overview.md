It is very close to RPA (Robotics process automation) products, but it brings different possibilities, such as the natural integration with the Service Management framework (SLAs, knowledge, portfolio, tickets, service portal, etc.)

We understand that the concepts of Service Management is very powerful and can go beyond IT, allowing interesting gains to the business. Neuro runs with the concept of Dynamic Application & Hot Deploy where there's no need to restart the server or system on any deploy.

## Why adopt it?Â 


Application development can often be time-consuming and expensive, as well as
exposing a high risk to the business. CITSmart Neuro presents intelligent
dynamics of business process automation and drag and drop screen construction,
meaning you can drag pre-defined elements to create the screens in a flexible,
secure and agile way. In addition, it has a very high level of interoperability,
allowing you to integrate your new application with any other legacy system. As
the business rules of these applications change constantly in
organizations/systems, the solution is prepared to work with the dynamism that
the business demands, these business rules are created in a practical way and
can be reused, avoiding waste.
